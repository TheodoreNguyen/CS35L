1. How can you get man to print all the commands that have a specific word in
their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man
man)

 Use the command

	man -K <specific word/phrase to search in man pages>



2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system?

 The "cp" program is located at "/bin/cp", while the "wc" program is
located at "/usr/bin/wc"



3. What executable programs have names that are just one character long, and
what do they do?

They are essentially scripts the user has created through code compilation; it
depends on what the script says. For example, using g++ to compile C++ code
will yield an a.out executable file.



4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/cc, which
file actually is executed?

the command /usr/bin/cc actually executes the /usr/bin/gcc command. This is
discovered by typing "file /usr/bin/cc"



5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic
mode g-s mean, in terms of permissions?

typing "chmod g-s" followed by the filename will change the permissions of
that file - it removes permission to use the setuid
and setgid modes from the users who are members of the file's group.



6. What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified in
the last 3 days?

typing "find <path> -mtime -3" will search the directory listed under <path>
for all files modified in the last 3 days



7. Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in the last 3
days.

.
./nsdefault
./Desktop
./Documents
./Downloads
./new
./.emacs.d
./.emacs.d/auto-save-list




8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic
links?

350



9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory?

sgmlwhich



10. Where does the locale command get its data from?

it gets it from the current environment variables



11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name?


commands that are used for sorting text - divides a region of text via
comparing text




12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-a through C-z do? Can you list their
actions concisely?

C-a     move to beginning of a line
C-b     move backwards a characer
C-c     mode-specific-command-prefix
C-d     delete character at cursor
C-e     move cursor to end of the line
C-f     move forward a character
C-g     keyboard-quit
C-h     help-command
C-i	insert tab
C-j 	replaces a return character
C-k     kill-line
C-l     recenter-top-bottom
C-m	insert endline
C-n     goes to next line
C-o     open-line
C-p     previous line
C-q     quoted insert
C-r	searches in reverse
C-s	search
C-t     transpose-characters
C-u     universal-argument
C-v     scrolls up
C-w	kills marked region
C-x     Control-X-prefix 
C-y	yanks aka pasted last deleted
C-z     suspend-frame


13.In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?


The C-g keystroke allows one to cancel cancel a command or action that has
been started in emacs. It is analogous to killing a
command in UNIX by pressing CTRL+C



14.What does the Emacs yank function do?

The yank function reinserts text that was previously killed (aka, text that
was removed and thus removed from the kill ring)




15.When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the
output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired
command?

The ls -l command only allows showing of the directory with details -
different options are needed for sorting. Dired, however, formats the printed
output and allows working with files from different directories.
