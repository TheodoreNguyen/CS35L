CS35L Fall 2014 Week 4 Lab 4: managing a backreported change

- I created a new directory for assignment 4 to get a copy of Diffutils
  repository

- I went to the link 

http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=diffutils

 and I copied the command 

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

 and I ran the command in my terminal, which generated a directory called
 diffutils

- I went to the newly created diffutils directory

cd /u/eng/class/classeen/assign4/diffutils/

- I ran the command

git log > ../git-log.txt

 to get a log of changes to Diffutils' master branch and store it

- I ran the command

git tag > ../git-tags.txt

 to generate a list of tags used for Diffutils and store it

- I used emacs on the git-log.txt to locate the phrase "like this" in order 
 to find the hash number for the desired commit. I copied the hash number

- I ran the command

git show [hash number] > ../quote-patch.txt

 to store the desired patch contents.

- I ran the command

git checkout v3.0 -b version3.0

 to checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils

- I ran 

patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt 

 to patch, skipping 3 times during the patch

- I ran 

git status

 to get the status

- I patched the files by hand and using emacs

- I copied the rej changes into the original file and inputted that with a +

- I ran

git clean -f 

 to clean the files not used

- I ran

git status

 and then

git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

 to produce the 391 line file 

- I read README-hacking to verify the command scenario

- I git cloned the old version again and compared it to the modified version
 post-build; I ran diff to see the differences. The files were not identical,
showing changes in the ` and ' via changes in the code.
