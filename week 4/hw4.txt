CS35L week 4 homework 4 Fall 2014: Verifying and publishing a backported
change

- I ran the command

git checkout v3.0 -b 'quote'

 to checkout another branch of v3.0 of Diffutils

- I ran the command

patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

 to install the change into the new branch, modifying the .c files kept

- I commited the files changed by the patch and ran the following commands
 
bootstrap
configure
make
make check
make distdir

 and then checked the ChangeLog to conform that it contained the commit,
 composing the changelog and commiting my changes to the new branch

- I ran the command

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

 to generate the formatted-patch.txt 

- I checked if the patch worked: I ran 

git checkout 3.0 -b 'temporary'
git am formatted-patch.txt

 and built it via the README commands, which was verified when running 

make check

- I ran

make distdir 

 and inspected the resulting file and ChangeLog that had the original 
 commited message.
