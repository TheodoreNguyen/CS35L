CS35L Fall 2014 Week 6 Laboratory: SSH setup and use in applications

- I first put the disc with Ubuntu on it inside my machine, then booted and
  spammed the F12 button to get to the alternate-boot screen. I selected boot
 CD/ROM drive to boot from the CD, Ubuntu. I booted from Ubuntu's disk,
 waiting for the OS to warmup. After getting to the desktop, I opened the
"terminal" to ready myself to execute the rest of the commands.

- I typed in the following commands

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

 to make sure I was updated and then to install the openssh server

- Afterwards, I ran the following commands

sudo useradd -d /home/ashi/ -m ashi
sudo passwd ashi

 to create a username "ashi" and a password for the "ashi"; I was prompted
with the password prompt afterwords, and made the password "ashi" as well.

- I then ran

cd /home/ashi
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R ashi .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
ifconfig

 I then gave my partner the ip address under the link, 10.95.81.35

ps aux | grep ssh

 I was prompted to make a password (locally) which I did, and then i had to
 enter it at one point.

- Afterwords, my partner typed in the following commands

ssh-keygen
ping server_ip_addr
CTRL + C (to stop pinging)
ssh-copy-id -i ashi@10.95.81.35

 prompted for password input, inputted ashi

ssh-add 
ssh -X ashi@10.95.81.35
xterm
 
 and then another window opens for input

firefox
 
 and then a firefox page opens.


- This was repeated for my run as well - my partner ran my commands, and I ran
  his (for a different username, password, and IP address, of course).
 Password input for login weas not required after the first time for password
 input.
