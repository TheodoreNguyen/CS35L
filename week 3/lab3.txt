CS35L week 3, laboratory exercise 3

- I first created a new directory in my home directory for assignment 3,
  found under:

 /u/eng/class/classeen/assign3

- Afterwards, I copied the link to download Coreutils 7.6 found under
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
 and downloaded the file using the "wget" command

 wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

- Then, I extracted the coreutils file using the tar command as follows

 tar -zvxf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

- I go to the newly created coreutils-7.6 directory containing the files I
  just extracted

 cd coreutils-7.6

- I run the command 

 ./configure 

which is run because the C compiler may be in different places on different
systems, different systems are using different shells, as well as a myriad of
many other things the program may need to know before running the program. In
the end, it builds the Makefile for the program.

This is followed up by running the command

 make

which essentially builds the program, executing make, looking for the first
target in the recently made Makefile and executing the instructions to build
an executable program.

Finally, finish with running

 make install

which evokes make to find the target install in Makefile to install the
program.

- AFterwards, I check the locale to see if my locale is set to "en_US.UTF-8"
  using the command "locale", and indeed it is

- I go to the src directory:

 cd /u/eng/class/classeen/assign3/coreutils-7.6/src/

- I run the command 

 ./ls -l

to check the date format that is outputted. Indeed, the date format for all
the files is listed in the form YYYY-MM-DD, so we can introduce the patch to
change it to form "MONTH DAY YEAR"

- I accessed the webpage containing Brady's patch at
  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html
 and read the documentation, particularly the patch itself.
- I accessed that I had to add the lines in the patch itself which contained a
  "+" character on the left side, and remove the lines that contained a "-"
 character within the code of the "ls.c" file found under coreutils-7.6/ls.c 

- I went to the directory containing ls.c
 
 cd /u/eng/class/classeen/assign3/coreutils-7.6/src

- I opened ls.c in emacs to modify the file via patching myself

 emacs ls.c

- I went to the section of the ls.c code that was specific to the patch, which
  was on line 2014, using emacs go to line function

 M+g+g 2014

- I deleted the duplicate line of code that said 

 case_long_iso_time_style:

- I scrolled down to the nearby for-loop that I also had to modify, and
  deleted the following code

                  {
                     char const *locale_format =
                      dcgettext (NULL, long_time_format[i], LC_TIME);
                     if (locale_format == long_time_format[i])
                       goto case_long_iso_time_style;
                     long_time_format[i] = locale_format;
                  }


- Afterwards, I inserted the following code in its place

                 long_time_format[i] =
                   dcgettext (NULL, long_time_format[i], LC_TIME);

- I saved the newly modified ls.c using commands 

 C-x C-s

  and exited the emacs prompt 

 C-x C-c

- I ran the command "make" after returning to the coreutils-7.6 home directory

 cd /u/eng/class/classeen/assign3/coreutils-7.6
 make

- I went back to the src directory and ran ls -l to verify if the changes were
  compete - and they were

 cd src
 ./ls -l
